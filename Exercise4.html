<h1>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</h1>

<p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, commonly referred to as ML or MLBB, is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Moonton, a Chinese video game developer and publisher based in Shanghai. Moonton was recently acquired by Nuverse, a gaming unit by Bytedance, for around $4 million. Released in 2016, the game grew in popularity worldwide, most prominently in Southeast Asia, and has since crossed the 1 billion downloads feat, with peak monthly players of 100 million. In 2021, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang achieved an all-time gross of US$1 billion with 44 percent of its revenue emanating from outside Asia, making it the top mobile game of its genre with the most global appeal.</p>
<p>At its core, the game pits 2 teams of 5 against each other in real time with at least 10-second matchmaking and 10-minute matches. Featuring traditional battle arena gameplay, players must fight over three lanes to take the enemy's tower and defend their own. Like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training to level up or pay to play angle—winners and losers are decided based on skill, ability, and strategy. The game is free-to-play and is only monetized through in-game purchases like characters and skins. Each player can control a selectable character, called “Hero”, with unique abilities and traits. There are 6 roles that define the main purpose of heroes: “Tank”, “Marksman”, “Assassin”, “Fighter”, “Mage”, and “Support”. These roles determine the responsibilities of players for their respective teams. Players can also set specific builds for heroes which include in-game items and emblems.</p><br>

<h3><b>Mobile Legend Hero Roles</b><br></h3>
<br><b>Tank</b>
<br>Tank heroes are the most durable among all mobile legends heroes. These front-line giants help in attacking enemies. They urge their teammates who are using marksman or assassin heroes to facilitate in the attack. Tanks also help to protect fragile heroes. You cannot determine the tank’s skills in its durability alone. When used properly, a tank could be the strongest hero in mobile legends.
<br>
<br><b>Assassin</b>
<br>Assassin heroes are the ones who focus on the positioning of the battle. They wisely plan their attack and tactically kill their enemies. Assassins choose their targets and aim at them carefully. Because they have low hit points (HP), it’s ideal for the experienced gamers to use them. Some fighters are less durable, making fighters easy to kill if used wrongly.
<br>
<br><b>Marksman</b>
<br>Looking for heroes that can do strategic attacks from a distance? Well, marksman heroes are perfect for you. This type of hero is best paired with tanks or fighters. A marksman destroys turrets quickly, too. During a game, it is best to stay at an ideal distance to protect this hero. Marksman heroes are less durable, so that makes it easy for them to get killed.
<br>
<br><b>Fighter</b>
<br>Marksman heroes fight from a distance, along with tanks. Meanwhile, fighter heroes fight closer to their enemy, making sure they leave a huge loss. Fighters can be used alone; however, teaming up with a marksman will be of huge help.
<br>
<br><b>Mage</b>
<br>Mage in MOBA games means magician. They cause damage to nearby enemies using magic. Given this, mage heroes are highly important in any team. Their main strength is not their physical attack but their ability effects. Most of the mage heroes in Mobile Legends are low in durability, so be careful when trying to fight the enemies alone.
<br>
<br><b>Support</b>
<br>Support heroes protect their allies in battles. Their main role is to aid their teammates. Support heroes help mobile legends heroes that are less durable and easy to kill, such as the marksman heroes.</p>
<br>

<h3><b>Mobile Legends Game Mode</b></h3>
<br><b>Classis</b>
<br>It is the first game mode. All other game modes are based on the Classic rules. This mode allows you to play 5 vs 5 without fear of losing Rank, but your win rate will be affected, both on the hero side and overall. Classic Mode is ideal for beginners to Mobile Legends who want to get a feel for the game. You can use any hero you have, as well as the Weekly Free Heroes and trial cards, at your leisure. However, no two heroes will exist in the same squad. You won’t be able to alter heroes until you’ve confirmed to equip them, so choose wisely. If you want to play more casually or refine your skills with a new hero, Classic Mode is a great place to start.<br>

<br><b>Versus AI</b>
<br>It will put players against each other in a 5 VS. 5 matchup, considerably like any other mode. However, instead of competing against real-time opponents, you can compete against computer-controlled opponents. You will be up against an AI (Artificial Intelligence) team that is controlled by a computer. In most cases, the VS A.I Mode is used as a practice ground for new heroes. Since the result of a match played in this game mode has no bearing on your game statistics, you will win battle points after a VS A.I match is completed. Players will practice against the machine with up to four mates, as normal.<br>

<br><b>Rank</b>
<br>Ranked Game’s seven division are Warrior, Elite, Master, Grandmaster, Epic, Legend, and Mythic, which run for three months and are arranged from lowest to highest: Warrior, Elite, Master, Grandmaster, Epic, Legend, and Mythic. The lowest division in the game is Warrior, while the strongest is Mythical Glory. Players will be matched with opponents and allies that are in the same or close to the same Ranked Division as them. When you win a match in a Ranked Game, you will receive one star, while losing a Ranked Game will result in one star being deducted. Friends may be invited to play in ranked games with them. Solo, Duo, Trio, and Squad Match-ups are all possible in a Ranked Game.<br>

<br><b>Brawl</b>
<br>It willl give you the choice of choosing between two random heroes only. In both teams, there is only one lane and two turrets defending the base in this mode. When compared to Classic Mode and Ranked, Brawl matches normally last a lot less time. This form of match is ideal for restoring credit scores that have been damaged by news and AFK actions. Everyone will start with 800 gold and heroes at Level 3 instead of Level 1 at the start of the game. All players will spawn in a circle, which will be the only area where you can purchase items. Unless you are defeated and respawn within the circle, you will be unable to purchase any things until you leave the circle, regardless of how much gold you have.<br>

<br><b>Arcade</b>
<br>Mobile legends do not just offer the classic 5 versus 5 players but also come up with different types of matching and gameplay. In Arcade mode, there are several modes underneath it.<br>
<p style="margin-left:4%"> <b>Magic Chess mode.</b> This gameplay makes the player think of a strategic position of its heroes to eliminate all his opponents before him, last player standing will savor the victory.<br>

    <br><b>Mayhem mode.</b> It is a normal 5v5 battle but enhanced and powers up the heroes’ skills for a fast-paced game. Players can earn exp and gold quicker when they reach level four. This mode is quicker than the classic model of the game.<br>
    
    <br><b>Mirror mode.</b> In this mode, players will use one hero throughout the game. It is a 5v5, but the players only use one hero that their team most picks.<br>
    
    <br><b>Death battle mode.</b> In this mode, the player must choose a hero from a set of 12 random heroes. The list of heroes is the same for you and the opponent team. The first team to take 30 kills will win the match.<br>
    
    <br><b>Evolve mode</b> in this mode players, begins as an orb and they take energy lights to evolve into a minion. Once evolved, the players must kill monsters and other players to evolve. The player who became lord and wiped all the players, win the match.<br>
    
    <br><b>Ravage mode.</b> It is a 3vs3 mode in which each team must collect 15 Aquamarines and protect them for 30 seconds from the enemies. The struggle of this mode is when the player who holds the most aquamarine dies the enemy team has a chance to steal it.<br>
    
    <br><b>Chess TD mode.</b> In this mode, 6 players will be distributed into 6 maps to challenge each other and with minions. Players can purchase heroes from their lineup, loots, and enhancement gear for the troops to stop the opponent from reaching their tower. The map is random for every match. Almost like Magic Chest but the difference is the map. There are platforms here where heroes are placed and stop the opponent to reach the base.<br>
    
    <br><b>Mirror Mayhem mode.</b> This mode is a combination of the Mayhem mode and mirror mode. 5v5 players with buff up hero’s skills and fast-paced earning of gold and exp.<br>
    
    <br><b>Arena mode.</b> In this mode it is a 1v1 tower hustle game and the purpose is to annihilate the rival’s Little Commander.<br>
    
    <br><b>Shadow Brawl mode.</b> It is similar to the brawl mode, but it is combined with the mechanics of the Mirror mode.<br>
    
    <br><b>Survival mode.</b> Is a 3 player in a team versus the other 99 players on the battlefield. In this mode, the player will drop according to their wants to kill the monster for loot. Then like any other survival game, this mode fights until one team or one of the team survives the battleground.</p><br>
